                <h1><a href="/Blogs/blog2.html">Edwards Featured in AVS Journal: Advancing Vacuum Performance with Ti-Zr-V-Hf Alloy Coatings</a></h1>
                <p>
                    In this study, our team explored the pumping performance of various 
                    Ti-Zr-V-Hf alloy NEG coatings, focusing on how different morphologies 
                    and activation protocols impact their effectiveness. The research 
                    highlights the superior performance of dual-layered Ti-Zr-V-Hf alloy 
                    coatings, particularly in achieving higher sticking probabilities for 
                    gases like H2 and N2 at cryogenic temperatures -a breakthrough that holds 
                    significant implications for the R&D sector.
                    <br>A key part of the study involved testing the NEG-coated samples using 
                    an advanced test rig equipped with Edwards nEXT85H turbomolecular pumps 
                    (TMPs) and an Edwards nXDS15i scroll pump. This setup ensured optimal 
                    base pressure conditions, enabling accurate measurement of sticking 
                    probabilities and terminal capacities at UHV levels.
                    <br>The results demonstrated that dual (columnar layer on the dense layer)
                    coatings significantly enhanced sticking probabilities, particularly 
                    for H2 and N2. Our pumps played an essential role in maintaining the 
                    precise vacuum conditions required for these tests, affirming their 
                    reliability in high-performance applications.

                <p>
                    We are delighted to announce that we were again voted number one 
                    in the ‘Best Suppliers of Wafer Fabrication Equipment’ category 
                    and number three in ’10 Best Large Suppliers of Chip Making Equipment’ 
                    in 2024’s major semiconductor industry customer satisfaction survey, 
                    TechInsights.
                    <br>The 2024 TechInsights Customer Satisfaction Survey is a large 
                    industry-wide survey that allows us to get a real insight into how our 
                    customers in the semiconductor industry perceive Edwards. This year 
                    over 18,000 responses were received from participants representing 53% 
                    of the chip market, and 96% of subsystem customers worldwide.
