                    <h2>The article, titled "Evaluation of the pumping performance of combinations of Ti–Zr–V–Hf alloy nonevaporable getter coatings with different morphologies, activation protocols controlled at cryogenic temperatures," highlights Edwards' leading-edge research in nonevaporable getter (NEG) coatings.</h2>
                    <p>
                        In this study, our team explored the pumping performance of various 
                        Ti–Zr–V–Hf alloy NEG coatings, focusing on how different morphologies 
                        and activation protocols impact their effectiveness. The research highlights 
                        the superior performance of dual-layered Ti–Zr–V–Hf alloy coatings, particularly
                        in achieving higher sticking probabilities for gases like H2 and N2 at 
                        cryogenic temperatures -a breakthrough that holds significant implications 
                        for the R&D sector.
                        <br>A key part of the study involved testing the NEG-coated samples using 
                        an advanced test rig equipped with Edwards nEXT85H turbomolecular pumps 
                        (TMPs) and an Edwards nXDS15i scroll pump. This setup ensured optimal base 
                        pressure conditions, enabling accurate measurement of sticking probabilities 
                        and terminal capacities at UHV levels.
                        <br>The results demonstrated that dual (columnar layer on the dense layer) 
                        coatings significantly enhanced sticking probabilities, particularly for H2 
                        and N2. Our pumps played an essential role in maintaining the precise vacuum 
                        conditions required for these tests, affirming their reliability in 
                        high-performance applications.
