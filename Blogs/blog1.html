                    <p>
                        Vacuum pumps play an important role in degassing 
                        plastics to remove water vapour, toxic & corrosive gases 
                        and impurities that affect the quality of the product. Polymer 
                        melts are degassed at low pressures using vacuum pumps on extruders, 
                        when being compounded into different grades with additives and 
                        colourants and while being formed. Depending on your vacuum needs, 
                        our experts will select from our comprehensive range of pumps to deliver
                        the right vacuum system for your process.
